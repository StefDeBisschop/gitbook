# Golden Image

A golden image is a pre-configured template of Windows 10 that is used as a standard for creating identical copies of OS clients. It serves as a baseline for consistent and efficient deployment.

This golden image will have a clean install of Windows 10 and 3 pre-installed programs (VLC, Putty and Google Chrome). We will deploy this image later. This section will focus on creating the image itself via FOG.
