# Conclusion

In conclusion, setting up a new IT infrastructure for a small business for the fictional company 'Pandora' requires planning, research, and execution. In this project, we covered the key components of the infrastructure , including networking and active directory services, backup and recovery, file sharing, and client device deployment. We also discussed the hardware and software requirements for each component and the steps involved in setting them up.

By utilizing industry-standard tools and best practices, such as Cisco for networking, Windows Server for active directory services, Veeam Backup and Replication for backup and recovery, and FOG Project for client device deployment, we were able to create a robust and reliable IT infrastructure that can meet the needs of the business.

From my personal experience working on this project, I can say that it has been an exciting journey. As someone who is passionate about IT infrastructure and cloud computing, I've learned a lot about setting up a robust system that can support the needs of a small business.

I'm excited to apply this newfound knowledge to my future projects and endeavors, as I continue to build and improve upon IT systems. Overall, this has been a fulfilling and rewarding project, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to have worked on it.
