# The Pandora Project

The Pandora Project is the beginning of a start-to-end process of building a fully working SME (Small and medium-sized enterprises) network and system; from the intranet to the switches in the server room.

This is all a part of the graduate exam of Hogent, who made a couple of requirements to the exam, explained later in this post.

One of the first basic things to look at was the name of the fictional company; as you see in the title of this page, Pandora was born. I always like to start not only with a name, but also with a mission and what they do, to make it more interesting and fun.

> Pandora is a consulting firm that helps businesses improve their operations and increase their profitability. With a team of six experienced consultants and a dedicated IT team, Pandora has the expertise and resources to tackle any challenge. From developing strategic plans to streamlining processes, Pandora helps clients achieve their goals and reach their full potential. With a focus on delivering practical, actionable recommendations, Pandora has established itself as a trusted partner to businesses of all sizes. Whether you're looking to grow your company or simply want to make it run more efficiently, Pandora has the experience and know-how to help you succeed.

Now we got a name and a mission for Pandora, next is the design; I made it with a online generator

Now we got a name, mission and designs we can move on to the more administrative side of this project: planning.
